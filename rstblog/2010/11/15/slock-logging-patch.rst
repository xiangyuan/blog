Slock Logging Patch
===================

I love `slock <http://tools.suckless.org/slock>`_, a simple screenlocker written for `dwm
<http://dwm.suckless.org/>`_, but I was missing some logging functionality. So I've created a small
patch for slock 0.9 that enables logging of locks, unlocks and failed unlock attempts into a
logfile.

For download, see the `suckless.org [dev] mailinglist archive
<http://lists.suckless.org/dev/1011/6362.html>`_.
