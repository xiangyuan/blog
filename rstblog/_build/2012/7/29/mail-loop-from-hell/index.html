11:16 &lt; abrt&gt; since it's quiet in here I'll tell you a story.
11:16 &lt; abrt&gt; back in 1992, I had just graduated university and was interning at a government facility in
              newport news
11:16 &lt; abrt&gt; along with some friends from college. We made $7.25/hr and were living large.
11:16 &lt; qns&gt; hahahaha
11:17 &lt; qns&gt; You sound like Kevin Mitinick.
11:17 &lt; abrt&gt; we used to play practical jokes on each other all the time.
11:17 &lt; abrt&gt; mitnick was a pussy compared to us
11:17 &lt; qns&gt; :O
11:17 &lt; abrt&gt; anyway, I managed to break into my friend's university UNIX account. guessed his password. easy.
11:17 &lt; abrt&gt; how well do you know UNIX?
11:18 &lt; qns&gt; not well yet
11:18 &lt; abrt&gt; well, back in the day, they didn't have postfix or qmail any of these fancy mailservers
11:18 &lt; abrt&gt; they ran sendmail
11:18 &lt; abrt&gt; and they allowed individual .forward files
11:19 &lt; abrt&gt; the purpose of the .forward file was to forward your email that came to your account to the
              address in the .forward file.
11:19 &lt; abrt&gt; anyway, after I broke into my friend Matt's account, I set up his .forward file to be
              &quot;everyone&#64;***.edu&quot; which I knew was an alias for the entire college.
11:19 &lt; abrt&gt; I had just learned how to forge sendmail headers and was going to send him a very embarrassing
              email &quot;from his girlfriend&quot;
11:20 &lt; abrt&gt; fortunately for me, I decided to do a test run at 1730 on a Friday. Assuming the test run went
              well, the embarrassing forged email would go out the following Monday.
11:20 &lt; abrt&gt; so I sent a &quot;this is a test&quot; to Matt.
11:21 &lt; abrt&gt; and went home, drank some beers with Matt and Steve, and had a great weekend
11:21 &lt; abrt&gt; Monday morning I get into the lab and everyone's quiet, sort of whispering, and looking at me
11:21 &lt; abrt&gt; fuck me, right?
11:21 &lt; abrt&gt; I log into the gov UNIX system - and I have 13000 emails
11:22 &lt; abrt&gt; what I had forgotten was that &quot;everyone&#64;***.edu&quot; included Matt.
11:22 &lt; abrt&gt; so the email would get sent to everyone, including him, then he would add 10 lines of header,
              forward it to everyone, including him, ....
11:22 &lt; abrt&gt; mail loop from hell.
11:22 &lt; qns&gt; Did you get in trouble?
11:22 &lt; abrt&gt; well, here's the thing
11:22 &lt; abrt&gt; this was summer '92
11:22 &lt; abrt&gt; nobody at school, right?
11:23 &lt; abrt&gt; everyone had their email forwarded elsewhere
11:23 &lt; abrt&gt; and the professors got jobs at places like Camp Peary, and FBI, and other research
              organizations, ....
11:23 &lt; qns&gt; So you help them?
11:23 &lt; abrt&gt; and those systems couldn't handle the volume of mail, and they never thought to put the mail
              spool on its on separate partition
11:23 &lt; abrt&gt; so their systems crashed.
11:24 &lt; qns&gt; haha
11:24 &lt; qns&gt; So you triggered chaos all over.
11:24 &lt; abrt&gt; I managed to bring down 13 CIA offices, all FBI offices east of the Mississippi, and the entire
              Southeastern university Research Network.
11:24 &lt; etgr&gt; You can claim to have hacked the FBI
11:24 &lt; qns&gt; using e-mail.
11:24 &lt; abrt&gt; along with various other systems, but those were the biggies
11:24 &lt; qns&gt; I'd have shat myself
11:24 &lt; abrt&gt; I pretty much did.
11:25 &lt; abrt&gt; But back then, like possession of a fake ID, nobody really knew what to do to you for this sort
              of thing
11:25 &lt; abrt&gt; so I got a slap on the wrist, almost fired, and had to write a letter of apology to the head of
              the computer lab at university
11:25 &lt; abrt&gt; and I lost my university email account. :(
11:26 &lt; qns&gt; hahahahaha
11:26 &lt; abrt&gt; today I'd probably be sent to Guantanamo
11:26 &lt; qns&gt; Or you'd mysteriously disappear.  :P
11:26 &lt; abrt&gt; anyway, that's my story for the evening.
11:26 &lt; qns&gt;  I need a story like that on my resume.
11:26 &lt; abrt&gt; nah
11:26 &lt; abrt&gt; here's the thing
11:26 &lt; abrt&gt; that story doesn't go on a resume
11:27 &lt; abrt&gt; but - fast forward 10 years later.
11:27 &lt; qns&gt; Ahh
11:27 &lt; abrt&gt; I'm getting my clearance
11:27 &lt; abrt&gt; being interviewed by the suits from OPM
11:27 &lt; abrt&gt; and they leave the room, come back with a folder, and say, &quot;Tell us about SURANet and the CIA
              in 1992&quot;
11:27 &lt; abrt&gt; THAT's when I shat myself.
11:28 &lt; abrt&gt; BUT - good news - I got my clearance despite my history :)
11:28 &lt; qns&gt; Were they impressed?
11:28 &lt; abrt&gt; nah, they were laughing
