Creative SoundBlaster X-Fi under Linux
======================================

The new `linux kernel <http://kernel.org/>`_ 2.6.31 contains drivers for
the Creative SB X-Fi series. Please be aware that that kernel version is
still in testing status, so I don't recommend installing it on a
productive system.
