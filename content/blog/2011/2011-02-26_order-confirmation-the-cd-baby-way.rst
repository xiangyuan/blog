Order confirmation - the CD Baby way
====================================

I just received a pretty dang awesome confirmation-email for a CD order
at `CD Baby <http://cdbaby.com/>`_, a great indie music
onlineshop/label:

    Thanks for your order with CD Baby! Your CDs have been gently taken from our
    CD Baby shelves with sterilized contamination-free gloves and placed onto a
    satin pillow. A team of 50 employees inspected your CDs and polished them to
    make sure they were in the best possible condition before mailing. Our
    packing specialist from Japan lit a candle and a hush fell over the crowd as
    he put your CDs into the finest gold-lined box that money can buy. We all
    had a wonderful celebration afterwards and the whole party marched down the
    street to the post office where the entire town of Portland waved "Bon
    Voyage!" to your package, on its way to you, in our private CD Baby jet on
    this day, February 25, 2011. We hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD
    Baby. In commemoration, we have placed your picture on our wall as "Customer
    of the Year." We're all exhausted but can't wait for you to come back to
    CDBABY.COM!! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Sigh... We miss you already.
    We'll be right here at http://cdbaby.com/, patiently awaiting your return.

Awesome - makes me want to submit another order :)
