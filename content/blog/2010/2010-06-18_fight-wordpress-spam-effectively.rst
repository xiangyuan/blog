Fight Wordpress spam effectively
================================

:tags: wordpress

My solution to stop wordpress comment spam is a combination of three Wordpress plugins:

    `Akismet <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/akismet/>`_ has protected your site from 11,247
    spam comments already, but there's nothing in your spam queue at the moment. Since its last
    activation on May 25, 2010

    `NoSpamNX <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nospamnx/>`_ has stopped 385 birdbrained Spambots
    (17 per Day).
    
    2,391 spam comments have been automatically discarded by the `Conditional CAPTCHA
    <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-conditional-captcha/>`_ plugin.

Since the time I started using this combination a few months ago, I have only had about 3 spam
comments in my comment queue.
