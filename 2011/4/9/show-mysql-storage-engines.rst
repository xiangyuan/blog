Show MySQL Storage Engines
==========================

If you have ever wanted to know the storage engine type of every table
in one of your MySQL databases, you know how tedious that can be.

I have written a Python script that will simplify that task. You can get
it on
`Github <https://github.com/gwrtheyrn/MySQL-Show-Storage-Engines>`_.

Usage:
~~~~~~

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ ./show-engines.py

or

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ python show-engines.py
