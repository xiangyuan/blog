Gustave Doré - Free Kindle Screensaver Images
=============================================

With the
`"Jailbreak" <http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=88004>`_
for the Kindle 3, you also have the possibility to exchange the default
"screensaver" images provided by Amazon. Although I like the default
screensavers, I got inspired by the look of `Melody's Piranesi’s Carceri
screensavers <http://redeemingqualities.wordpress.com/2009/01/13/piranesis-carcerikindle-screensavers/>`_
to create a set of 19 screensaver pictures with some of the awesome
engravings by the French artist `Gustave
Doré <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Dor%C3%A9>`_.

The original pictures are public domain, the composition of images I
created is released under the creative commons license
`cc-by-3.0 <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/>`_. This means
you are free to use, share and remix it as long as you link back to this
blog entry. (Of course this only applies to the edited versions, not to
the images themselves, which you can find on Wikipedia). Feedback is
welcome and appreciated.
