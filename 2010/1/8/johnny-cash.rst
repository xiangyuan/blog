Johnny Cash
===========

Zitat von Steve Earle aus dem CD-Booklet einer "Johnny Cash Live at
Folsom Prison"-Rerelease:

    "As I got older and discovered the Beatles and the Stones and Bob
    Dylan, only Johnny Cash survived the shift in my musical tastes.
    Cash was different. He was a BADASS. He wore a lot of black and he
    sang about murder and dope and adultery and ghosts. He had genuine
    attitude. His music, more than anyone else's, was simultaneously
    COUNTRY and ROCK."
