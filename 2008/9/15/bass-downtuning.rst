Bass-Downtuning
===============

Zitat aus dem
`Endtime-Forum <http://www.nordicfest.no/forum/viewtopic.php?p=341042#341042>`_:

    OK HERE IS MY EXPLANATION WHY DOWNTUNING IS EMO! DOWN TUNING WAS
    INVENTED BY EMOS! HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A EMO GUY? TINY LITTLE WIMPY
    \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. THEY ARE SO SKINNY AND WEAK THEY WOULD NOT BE
    ABLE TO LIFT THEIR CRYING GIRLFRIENDS CHIHUAHUAS IF THEY TRIED! THEY
    WANT TO START A BAND, BUT THE BASS PLAYER ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH THE
    TURN THE TUNING KNOB ALL THE WAY UP TO E A D G, EVEN WITH THE HELP
    OF THEIR BANDMEMBERS (notice that emos are always playing 4
    strings...the bass guitar would just bee too heavy with 5 strings)
    ...SO THE SOLUTION WAS TO TUNE IT UP AS MUCH AS THEY WERE ABLE TO,
    THEN ALL THE EMO WANNABEES SAID "OH COOL...IT'S TUNED DOWN", AND
    THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THE TRUE STORY BEHIND THE SO CALLED DOWNTUNING,
    CAUSE THEY NEVER TOOK THEIR TIME TO RESEARCH IT!!!
