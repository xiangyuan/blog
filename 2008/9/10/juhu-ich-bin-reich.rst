Habe soeben ein Mail erhalten welches auf den ersten Moment ziemlich
seriös gewirkt hat. Die Seriosität ist aber beim lesen schnell
verflogen.

    Sir/Madam,
    I know this must be a surprise to you as we have not met before. I
    am humbly seeking your cooperation to safeguard 14M US Dollars. This
    fund was raised from an over-invoiced contract which had already
    been executed.
    I will compensate you with 15% at the end of the business. I know
    that every business has a risk but I hope you will not cause me any
    risk. Please reply for more details. Thank you.
